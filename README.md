# test-creator
take the pictures from a list of questions, combine a set of them into a pdf, and then we are left with a test that is ready to print.  
This assumes the file structure is similar to : ./statmethods/q01/statmethods-a1-2.png
The code will distinguish if a (q)uestion or (a)nswer picture is found by finding index 30 of file path above.
